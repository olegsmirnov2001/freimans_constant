\subsection{Geometrical interpretation}

Markov spectrum $M$ is the projection of some subset $\mathcal{S} \subset C_4 \times C_4$ onto the diagonal.

In these terms, \textbf{rectangle} is a rectangle and \textbf{subrectangles} are its subrectangles.

We will consider a family of rectangles whose projections cover the beginning of Hall's Ray.

Then we will present the algorithm to split rectangle into subrectangles so that their projections cover the projections of initial rectangle.

The more <<squarish>> the rectangle, the easier the step.

That's why we will bound the aspect ratio of rectangles (see \textbf{good} rectangle).

Formulas to evaluate aspect ratio are given in section \oldref{section_calculations}.
