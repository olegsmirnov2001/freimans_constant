The following theorem describes the best possible quality of approximation for an arbitrary $\alpha$:

\begin{theorem}[Hurwitz]
	\label{theorem_hurwitz}
	For any irrational $\alpha$,
	there exist infinitely many rationals $\frac{p}{q}$ such that
	\begin{equation*}
		\label{condition_hurwitz}
		\left| \alpha - \frac{p}{q} \right| < \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{5} q^2}.
	\end{equation*}
	On the other hand, for any $c > \sqrt{5}$ the inequality
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:markov-inequality}
		\left| \varphi - \frac{p}{q} \right| < \dfrac{1}{c q^2}.
	\end{equation}
	has only finitely many solutions,
	where $\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$
	is the golden ratio.
\end{theorem}
