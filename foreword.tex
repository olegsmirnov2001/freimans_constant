The main subject of this paper is the Markov spectrum or, to be more precise,
its final portion, called the Hall's Ray.

Its existence have been proven by Hall more than a century ago;
however, evaluating the exact value of the start of the Hall's Ray took time.

In 1975, Freiman found and proved this constant.

This paper contains the translated and modernized approach from the original paper.
