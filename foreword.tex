\section{Foreword}

The main subject of this paper is the Markov spectrum or, to be more precise,
its final portion, called the Hall's Ray.
Its existence has been proven by M. Hall in 1947;
however, finding this constant took time.

In 1975, Freiman evaluated the exact value of the start of the Hall's Ray.

This paper contains the translated and modernized approach from the original paper.

It also pretends to be the verification of the Freiman's theorem.

I am grateful to my scientific advisor Carlos Matheus
for valuable advise, remark about the thickness argument,
and help in understanding the geometry of the Markov spectrum.
