\subsection{Length of $\D_1$ or $\D_2$}

Let's fix some terms of continued fraction $[0; q_1, q_2, q_3, ..., q_n]$.

We will often need to measure difference
\begin{equation*}
	[0; q_1, q_2, q_3, ..., q_n, \frac{1}{\T{R}}] - 
	[0; q_1, q_2, q_3, ..., q_n, \frac{1}{\T{L}}],
\end{equation*}

where $\T{}$'s are some continuations of the continued fraction.

They generally look like $\T{} = [0;12\overline{13}]$ or something\footnote{%
	Here, as always in this book, $\overset{k}{\overline{abc}}$
	means $k$-times repetition of $abc$,
	and $\overline{abc}$ means infinite repetition.}.
We will set $\T{}$'s explicitly.

For the general proof, $\T{}$'s will be taken from table \oldref{fg:table-thetas}.

\begin{designation}
	For given continuation $\T{i}$ denote by $\varepsilon_i$ the resulting continued fraction:
	\begin{equation}\label{epsilon_rule}
		\varepsilon_i = [0; q_1, q_2, ..., q_n, \frac{1}{\T{i}}].
	\end{equation}
\end{designation}

Then the following equality takes place:

\begin{equation}\label{varepsilons_difference}
	| \varepsilon_i - \varepsilon_j | = 
	\dfrac{| \T{i} - \T{j} |}
	{Q_n^2 \left(1 + pQ_i\right) \left(1 + pQ_j\right)},
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation*}
	p = \dfrac{Q_{n-1}}{Q_n}.
\end{equation*}
