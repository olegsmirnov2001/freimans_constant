%Firstly, we will need to distinguish 

We will set boundaries for rectangles in a different way.

To distinguish rectangles, we will introduce the notion of left- or right-shortened rectangles.

It is given in subsections \oldref{sbsc:resection}-\oldref{sbsc:shortened_explanation}.

Subsections \oldref{sbsc:boundaries_nonformal}-\oldref{sbsc:boundaries_formal}
provide the rules for boundaries $\D_1'$, $\D_1''$, $\D_2'$, $\D_2''$.
