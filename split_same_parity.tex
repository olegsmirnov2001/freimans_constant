\section{Induction, $i_1 \equiv i_2 \pmod 2$}

This section deals with the case $i_1 \equiv i_2 \pmod 2$.
Again, let $\D = \{ a_{i_1}, ..., a_{i_2}\}$ be a horizontal rectangle,
satisfying conditions from sections \oldref{sc:boundaries} and \oldref{sc:good}.

As in section \oldref{sc:odd}, we will assume that both $i_1$ and $i_2$ are even;
for the different parity the same logic can be repeated,
with bounds in the inequalities swapped and illustrations reflected.

\subsection{Case $\{3,2\}$ is right-normal}

We start with the case
\begin{equation}\label{15.2}
	\g - \g' > \d - \d',
\end{equation}
where
\Tp{25}{3}{66}{63}

\textit{
	Freiman ceases to give explanatory illustrations to inequalities like \ref{15.2} in this section
	and suggests the reader to make them on their own.
}

Inequality \ref{15.2} expands to
\begin{equation}\label{15.3}
	0,31 > q \up{3}{63} \up{25}{66}.
\end{equation}

The rounding is done to a higher precision
so that \ref{15.2} and \ref{15.5} both follow from \ref{15.3}.

The constants $\T{25}$ and $\T{3}$ are chosen such that the subrectangle $\{3,2\}$
which will occur in the further splitting is right-normal.
This condition allows us to choose the largest possible constant in the lhs of \ref{15.3}.

So, the following condition should take place:
\begin{equation}\label{15.4}
	\g - \g' > 1,4(\d - \d'),
\end{equation}
where
\Tp[,]{28}{22}{64}{61}
which expands to
\begin{equation}\label{15.5}
	0,345 > q \up{22}{61} \up{28}{64}.
\end{equation}

Let's show that \ref{15.5} follows from \ref{15.3}:
\begin{equation}\label{15.6}
	\begin{gathered}
		0,344 \pu{61}{22} > 0,31 \pu{66}{3}\\
		\ArrowBetweenLines
		1,1 > \uu{22}{3} \pp{66}{61}.
	\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

Checking it by replacing $p$ and $p'$ with their upper bound 0.8 and increasing the rhs.

In consideration of \ref{15.3},
in case $\D'$ is defined with \ref{eq:bound-l-nnn} and \ref{eq:bound-l-nns},
we can take $\{1,\}$, $\{2,\}$, and $\{3,\}$,
and in case \ref{eq:bound-l-sn} and \ref{eq:bound-l-ss}
subrectangles $\{1,\}$ and $\{2,\}$ are enough.

In the rest section we will assume that \ref{15.3} doesn't take place, that is,
\begin{equation}\label{15.7}
	0,31 \leqslant q \up{3}{63} \up{25}{66}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Name}

Consider condition
\begin{equation}\label{15.8}
	\g - \g' > \d - \d',
\end{equation}
where
\Tp[,]{63}{36}{66}{63}
which expands to
\begin{equation}\label{15.9}
	0,634 > q \up{36}{63} \up{63}{66}.
\end{equation}

To justify the choice $\T{\g} = \T{\g'} = \T{63}$, we need to check
\begin{equation}\label{15.10}
	\g - \g' > 1,4 (\d - \d'),
\end{equation}
where
\Tp[,]{64}{61}{64}{61}
which expands to
\begin{equation}\label{15.11}
	0,714 > q\up{61}{61}\up{64}{64}.
\end{equation}
The last inequality follows from \ref{15.9}, if
\begin{equation}
	\pp{63}{61} \pp{66}{64} \uu{61}{36} \uu{64}{63} < 1,125,
\end{equation}
which is easily checked by substituting $p = p' = 0.8$, as in \ref{15.6}.

If \ref{15.8} takes place, then take subrectangles $\{1,\}$ and $\{2,\}$.
Thus, in consideration of \ref{15.9}, cases \ref{eq:bound-l-sn} and \ref{eq:bound-l-ss} are over.

\subsection{Name}

Now turn to cases \ref{eq:bound-l-nnn} and \ref{eq:bound-l-nns} (IIa).
We will show that
\begin{equation}\label{15.12}
	\g - \g' < \d - \d',
\end{equation}
where
\Tp[,]{30}{25}{59}{3}
which can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}\label{15.13}
	0,3375 < q \up{25}{3} \up{30}{59}.
\end{equation}

The last inequality follows from \ref{15.7}, if
\begin{equation*}
	1,09 < \pp{63}{3} \pp{66}{59} \uu{30}{3},
\end{equation*}
which is checked by substituting $p = p' = 0,25$.

The inequality \ref{15.12} shows that, in consideration of \ref{15.9} and in case \ref{eq:bound-l-nnn},
the subrectangle $\{3,2\}$ intersects with $\{2,\}$, even if $\{3,2\}$ is right-shortened.

If $\D$ is left-shortened, then the splitting is over.
If it is left-normal, then subrectangles $J_k = \{\overset{k}{3}, \overset{k}{3}\}$ are added.

Check that, for example, $J_1 = \{3, 3\}$ is good.

We need
\begin{equation}\label{15.14}
	\g - \g' < 3,8 (\d - \d'),
\end{equation}
where
\Tp[,]{28}{1}{28}{1}
which expands to
\begin{equation}
	0,264 < q \up{1}{1} \up{28}{28}
\end{equation}
and follows from \ref{15.7}, if
\begin{equation*}
	1,17 > \uu{3}{1} \uu{25}{28} \pp{1}{63} \pp{28}{66},
\end{equation*}
which is obvious.

\textit{
	Here Freiman references the $\sqrt{21}$ proof from \S9.
	I will translate it soon.
}

\subsection{Name}

It remains to deal with \ref{eq:bound-l-nns} (IIb).

Suppose that the following inequality takes place:
\begin{equation}\label{15.15}
	\g - \g' < \d - \d'
\end{equation}
with
\Tp[.]{30}{25}{63}{36}

Inequality \ref{15.15} is rewritten as follows.
Instead of 0,703 in the lhs take constant 0,73 to assure $\{3, 2\}$ normality:
\begin{equation}\label{15.16}
	0,73 < q \up{25}{36} \up{30}{63}.
\end{equation}

Subrectangle $\{3, 2\}$ is normal, if
\begin{equation*}\label{15.17}
	1,4 (\g - \g') < \d - \d',
\end{equation*}
where
\Tp[,]{28}{22}{64}{61}
which expands to
\begin{equation*}
	0,6773 < q \up{22}{61} \up{28}{64}
\end{equation*}
and follows from \ref{15.16}, if
\begin{equation*}
	1,076 > \pp{61}{36} \pp{64}{63} \uu{30}{22},
\end{equation*}
which is checked as \ref{15.6}.

In addition to subrectangles $\{1,\}$ and $\{2,\}$ we can now take $\{3, 2\}$,
and case \ref{eq:bound-l-nns} is done, if \ref{15.16}, \ref{15.9}, and \ref{15.7} all take place.

Note that \ref{15.16} does not depend on \ref{15.9}.
We will need it below.
If \ref{15.16} doesn't take place, that is,
\begin{equation}\label{15.18}
	0,73 \geqslant q \up{25}{36} \up{30}{63},
\end{equation}
then in case \ref{eq:bound-l-nns} the subrectangles $\{2,\}$ and $\{3, 2\}$ may not intersect when
\begin{equation*}
	\D_1'(2) + \D_2'(2) > \D_1''(3) + \D_2''(2).
\end{equation*}

The system of subrectangles covering the interval $\left(\D_1''(3) + \D_2''(2); \D_1'(2) + \D_2'(2)\right)$
will be found further.

Suppose that \ref{15.9} doesn't take place, that is,
\begin{equation}\label{15.19}
	0,634 \leqslant q \up{36}{63} \up{63}{66}.
\end{equation}

At first, consider subrectangles $\{1,\}$ and $\{2, 1\}$.
Rectangle $\D$ is good, so they intersect.

Showing that $\{2, 1\}$ is good.
We need the following:
\begin{equation}
	3,8 (\g - \g') > \d - \d',
\end{equation}
where
\Tp[,]{64}{29}{95}{65}
which expands to
\begin{equation*}
	1,36 > q \up{29}{65} \up{64}{95}
\end{equation*}
and is easily checked.

Now consider subrectangle $\{3, 1\}$, if it is good.
The following is required:
\begin{equation*}
	3,8 (\g - \g') > \d - \d',
\end{equation*}
where
\Tp[,]{28}{1}{95}{65}
which expands to
\begin{equation}\label{15.20}
	0,696 > q \up{1}{65} \up{28}{95}.
\end{equation}

Let the negation of \ref{15.20}, the inequality \ref{15.21}, take place:
\begin{equation}\label{15.21}
	0,696 \leqslant q \up{1}{65} \up{28}{95}.
\end{equation}

Then considering the subrectangle $\{3, 11\}$ and showing that it intersects with $\{2, 1\}$.
The following inequality is needed:
\begin{equation}\label{15.22}
	\g - \g' < \d - \d',
\end{equation}
where
\Tp[.]{30}{25}{79}{66}

The choice of $\Th$'s will be explained.

Inequality \ref{15.22} is transformed into
\begin{equation*}
	0,702 < q \up{25}{66} \up{30}{79},
\end{equation*}
which instantly follows from \ref{15.21}.

We have to show that
\begin{equation}\label{15.24}
	1,4 (\g - \g') < \d - \d',
\end{equation}
where
\Tp{33}{29}{68}{65}
which expands to
\begin{equation*}
	0,574 < q \up{29}{65} \up{33}{68},
\end{equation*}
which follows from \ref{15.21}.

The next subrectangle is $\{2, 2\}$.
Let's show that it intersects with $\{3, 11\}$ or $\{3, 1\}$.
The following is required:
\begin{equation}\label{15.25}
	\g - \g' > \d - \d',
\end{equation}
where
\Tp{63}{3}{65}{58}
which expands to
\begin{equation*}
	1,275 > q \up{3}{58} \up{63}{65},
\end{equation*}
which takes place.

The condition \ref{15.12} allows us to finish this case
by taking subrectangles $\{2, 3\}$, $\{3, 2\}$, and $\{3, 3\}$ or $J_k$
(the latter one in case $\D$ is left-normal).

\subsection{Name}

Turn to case \ref{eq:bound-l-nns} (IIb) with \ref{15.19} taking place.

In this case the system of subrectangles covering $\left[\D_1'(2) + \D_2'(2); \D_1'' + \D_2''\right]$
coincides with one for condition \ref{eq:bound-l-nnn},
and the system covering the interval to the left
coincides with the one for \ref{eq:bound-l-nns} (IIb) with \ref{15.9} taking place.

In cases \ref{eq:bound-l-sn} and \ref{eq:bound-l-ss}
the subrectangles $\{3, 1\}$ and $\{3, 11\}$
can not be considered, because of the rule of setting the left end of $\D$.
The interval $\left(\D_1'(2) + \D_2'(1); \D_1''(2) + \D_2''(2)\right)$ remains uncovered.

Let's move to the construction of the system of subrectangles covering
\begin{equation}\label{15.26}
	\left(\D_1''(3) + \D_2''(2), \D_1'(2) + 'D_2'(2)\right).
\end{equation}

Conditions \ref{15.7} and \ref{15.18} both take place.

At first consider the case \ref{15.15} takes place with the following choice of $\Th$'s:
\Tp{57}{19}{10}{63}
which expands to
\begin{equation}\label{15.27}
	0,677 < q \up{19}{10} \up{57}{63}.
\end{equation}

Interval \ref{15.26} is covered by the subrectangles $\{22, 311\}$ and $\{22, 32\}$.

We ensure that $\{3, 2\}$ and $\{22, 311\}$ intersect by demanding the condition \ref{15.27}.

Showing that $\{22, 311\}$ is good. We need
\begin{equation}
	\g - \g' < 3,43(\d - \d'),
\end{equation}
where
\Tp{60}{56}{14}{7}
which expands to
\begin{equation}\label{15.28}
	0,652 < q \up{56}{7} \up{60}{14},
\end{equation}
which follows from \ref{15.27}.

Showing that $\{22, 32\}$ is also good. We need
\begin{equation*}
	\g - \g' < 3,43 (\d - \d')
\end{equation*}
with
\Tp{60}{56}{21}{15}
expanding to
\begin{equation}\label{15.29}
	0,53 < q \up{56}{15} \up{60}{21},
\end{equation}
which follows from \ref{15.27}.

Subrectangles $\{22, 311\}$ and $\{22, 32\}$ intersect under condition
\begin{equation}
	3,43 (\g - \g') > \d - \d',
\end{equation}
where
\Tp{60}{56}{28}{1}
which transforms to
\begin{equation}\label{15.30}
	1,17 > q \up{56}{1} \up{60}{28},
\end{equation}
which follows from \ref{15.18}.

Finally, we have to show that
\begin{equation*}
	\g - \g' > \d - \d'
\end{equation*}
with
\Tp{59}{30}{36}{19}
expanding to
\begin{equation}\label{15.31}
	0,94 > q \up{30}{19} \up{59}{36},
\end{equation}
which follows from \ref{15.18}.

Further we can assume that the inequality \ref{15.32} takes place:
\begin{equation}\label{15.32}
	0,677 \geqslant q \up{19}{10} \up{57}{63}.
\end{equation}

Showing that $\{2, 2\}$ is left-normal, that is,
\begin{equation}
	\g - \g' > 1,4 (\d - \d')
\end{equation}
with
\Tp{33}{29}{33}{29}
expanding to
\begin{equation}\label{15.33}
	0,715 > q \up{29}{29} \up{33}{33}.
\end{equation}

Inequality \ref{15.33} follows from \ref{15.32}, if
\begin{equation}
	A(p, p') = \pu{10}{19} \pu{63}{57} \up{29}{29} \up{33}{33} < 1,053.
\end{equation}
Note that $F(p', p) \leqslant A(0.25, 0.8) = 0,997 < 1,053$.

Overall, if \ref{15.32} takes place, the inequality \ref{15.25} can be set with constants
\Tp{54}{29}{29}{25}
so it can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}\label{15.34}
	0,612 > q \up{29}{25} \up{54}{29}.
\end{equation}

At first, let \ref{15.34} not take place, that is,
\begin{equation}\label{15.35}
	0,612 \leqslant q \up{29}{25} \up{54}{29}.
\end{equation}

Check the condition \ref{15.15} with
\Tp{41}{19}{63}{10}
expanding to
\begin{equation}\label{15.36}
	0,492 < q \up{19}{10} \up{41}{63}.
\end{equation}
It follows from \ref{15.35}.

So $\{112, 311\}$ intersects with $\{3, 2\}$.

Showing that $\{113, 311\}$ is good.
Check the following inequality:
\begin{equation}
	\g - \g' < 3,8 (\d - \d')
\end{equation}
with
\Tp{55}{40}{14}{7}
expanding to
\begin{equation}
	0,49 < q \up{40}{7} \up{55}{14},
\end{equation}
and it follows from \ref{15.35}.

Now consider the subrectangle $\{112, 32\}$ and show that it intersects with $\{112, 311\}$.
It is so, if $\{112, 3\}$ is good, and it is enough to check that
\begin{equation*}
	3,8 (\g - \g') > \d - \d'
\end{equation*}
with
\Tp{55}{40}{28}{1}
which expands to
\begin{equation*}
	1,07 > q \up{40}{1} \up{55}{28},
\end{equation*}
which follows from \ref{15.32}.

Check that $\{112, 32\}$ is good. We need
\begin{equation*}
	\g - \g' < 3,43 (\d - \d'),
\end{equation*}
where
\Tp{55}{40}{21}{15}
which can be rewritten as
\begin{equation*}
	0,486 < q \up{40}{15} \up{55}{21},
\end{equation*}
which follows from \ref{15.35}.

The next two subrectangles are $\{2112, 33\}$ and $\{3112, 33\}$.

Show that the first one intersects with $\{112, 32\}$.
The inequality \ref{15.25} should take place with the following choice of constants:
\Tp[.]{54}{47}{24}{19}
This inequality expands to
\begin{equation*}
	0,765 > q \up{47}{19} \up{54}{24},
\end{equation*}
which follows from \ref{15.32}.

It is very easy to check that both $\{3113, 33\}$ and $\{3112, 33\}$ are good.

Let's show that they intersect. It is sufficient to check that $\{112, 3\}$ is normal.
For this we need the condition \ref{15.4} with
\Tp[.]{55}{49}{28}{22}

Obtain the condition
\begin{equation*}
	0,442 < q \up{49}{22} \up{55}{28},
\end{equation*}
which follows from \ref{15.35}.

Showing that $\{22, 311\}$ intersects with $\{3112, 33\}$.
We need the condition \ref{15.15} with
\Tp{57}{54}{25}{10}
which expands to
\begin{equation*}
	0,612 < q \up{54}{10} \up{57}{25},
\end{equation*}
which follows from \ref{15.35}.

Now consider the subrectangles $\{22, 311\}$ and $\{22, 32\}$.

They are good, if the conditions \ref{15.28} and \ref{15.29} take place, respectively.
In the investigated case we can use \ref{15.27}, but should rely on \ref{15.35}.

We will show that \ref{15.35} follows from \ref{15.28}.
We need
\begin{equation*}
	1,065 < \uu{56}{29} \uu{60}{54} \pp{25}{7} \pp{29}{14}.
\end{equation*}
This inequality is easily checked,
taking into account that $a_{i_2} = 1$, $a_{i_1} = 3$ and $p' \geqslant 0,75$.

The condition \ref{15.29} is easily checked.

The condition \ref{15.30} guarantees the intersection of the last two subrectangles,
while \ref{15.31} ensures the intersection of $\{22, 32\}$ and $\{2, 2\}$.

\subsection{Name}

Now suppose that \ref{15.34} takes place.

The first considered subrectangle is $\{312, 312\}$.

On page \ref{pageref} the condition \ref{15.12} i checked,
and it shows that $\{312, 312\}$ intersects with $\{3, 2\}$.

The considered subrectangle is normal. Indeed,
\begin{equation}\label{15.37}
	\g - \g' > 1,4 (\d - \d'),
\end{equation}
where
\Tp{33}{31}{6}{4}
which expands to
\begin{equation}\label{15.38}
	0,745 > q \left( \up{33}{4} \right)^2,
\end{equation}
and it follows from \ref{15.34}.

To show that $\{312, 312\}$ intersects with $\{312, 311\}$,
proving the inequality \ref{15.25} for the following constants:
\Tp[.]{49}{30}{8}{5}.

This is rewritten as
\begin{equation*}
	0,767 > q \left(\up{49}{5}\right)^2,
\end{equation*}
which trivially follows from \ref{15.38}.

The next subrectangle $\{212, 312\}$ is good, if
\begin{equation}\label{15.39}
	\g - \g' < 3,8 (\d - \d')
\end{equation}
with
\Tp{39}{24}{69}{2}
which expands to
\begin{equation}\label{15.40}
	0,492 < q \left(\up{34}{6}\right)^2.
\end{equation}

Suppose that \ref{15.40} doesn't take place, that is,
\begin{equation}\label{15.41}
	0,492 \geqslant q \left(\up{34}{6}\right)^2.
\end{equation}

In this case, consider the subrectangle $\{1212, 312\}$, which is good.

Show that $\{312, 311\}$ intersects either $\{212, 312\}$ or $\{1212, 312\}$.
For this we need the subrectangle $\{2121, 31\}$ to be good:
\begin{equation}\label{15.43}
	3,8 (\g - \g') > \d - \d',
\end{equation}
where
\Tp{37}{34}{14}{1}
which expands to
\begin{equation*}
	0,512 > q \up{34}{1} \up{37}{14},
\end{equation*}
which follows from \ref{15.41}.

Checking that $\{212, 311\}$ is good.
We need the following:
\begin{equation*}
	3,8 (\g - \g') < \d - \d',
\end{equation*}
where
\Tp[.]{39}{34}{14}{7}
Obtain the inequality
\begin{equation*}
	0,235 < q \left(\up{34}{14}\right)^2,
\end{equation*}
following from \ref{15.7}.

The next subrectangle is $\{312, 32\}$.
To show that it intersects with $\{212, 311\}$,
we need to check the condition \ref{15.25} with
\Tp{38}{30}{16}{11}
which expands to
\begin{equation*}
	1,1 > q \up{30}{11} \up{38}{16}
\end{equation*}
and therefore follows from \ref{15.31}.

Showing that $\{312, 32\}$ intersects with $\{312, 33\}$.
We need to check the condition \ref{15.25} with the following constants:
\Tp{32}{30}{23}{19}
which transforms to
\begin{equation*}
	0,945 > q \left(\up{32}{19}\right)^2,
\end{equation*}
and follows from \ref{15.31}.

The next subrectangle is $\{212, 32\}$.

Showing that it intersects with $\{312, 32\}$.
The condition \ref{15.15} is needed with the following $\Th$'s:
\Tp[.]{66}{32}{25}{16}

This in equivalent to
\begin{equation*}
	0,289 < q \up{32}{16} \up{66}{25},
\end{equation*}
following from \ref{15.7}.

Showing that $\{212, 32\}$ intersects with $\{1112, 311\}$.
We need the condition \ref{15.15} with
\Tp{41}{38}{20}{8}
expanding to
\begin{equation*}
	0,319 < q \up{38}{8} \up{41}{20},
\end{equation*}
and following from \ref{15.7}.

Let's figure out when the subrectangle $\{11112, 311\}$ is right-normal.
The condition \ref{15.24} is needed with
\Tp[.]{46}{44}{12}{14}
This expands to
\begin{equation}\label{15.44}
	0,392 < q \left(\up{44}{14}\right)^2.
\end{equation}

Now figuring out when $\{2122,311\}$ is normal.
Again, we require the condition \ref{15.24} with
\Tp{48}{49}{9}{7}
expanding to
\begin{equation}\label{15.45}
	0,575 > q \left(\up{49}{7}\right)^2.
\end{equation}

Now we will deduce (??) the condition when $\{1112, 311\}$ and $\{2112, 311\}$ overlap,
under the assumption of \ref{15.44} and \ref{15.45}.

The condition \ref{15.15} is required with the following constants:
\Tp{45}{45}{13}{8}
expanding to
\begin{equation}\label{15.46}
	0,438 < q \up{45}{8} \up{47}{13}.
\end{equation}
This follows from \ref{15.44}.

Now assume that \ref{15.45} doesn't take place, that is,
\begin{equation}\label{15.47}
	0,575 \leqslant q \left(\up{49}{7}\right)^2.
\end{equation}

In this case setting $\T{\d'}$ differently.
Let $\T{\d'}$ be $\T{10}$. Now \ref{15.15} transforms into
\begin{equation*}
	0,482 < q \up{45}{10} \up{47}{13},
\end{equation*}
which follows from \ref{15.47}.

Overall, the considered subrectangles intersect in case \ref{15.47} takes place,
and also in case both \ref{15.44} and \ref{15.45} take place.

Now assume that \ref{15.46} doesn't take place, that is,
\begin{equation}\label{15.48}
	0,438 \geqslant q \up{45}{8} \up{47}{13}.
\end{equation}

Showing that $\{1112, 311\}$ and $\{1112, 32\}$ overlap.
We need the inequality \ref{15.25} with the following constants:
\Tp{45}{41}{16}{13}
expanding to
\begin{equation*}
	0,484 > q \left(\up{45}{13}\right)^2,
\end{equation*}
which follows from \ref{15.48}.

To justify such choice of $\g'$ and $\d$ we need to show that $\{1112, 32\}$ is left-normal, that is,
\begin{equation*}
	\g - \g' > 1,4 (\d - \d'),
\end{equation*}
where
\Tp[.]{42}{40}{17}{15}
Rewrite it as follows:
\begin{equation*}
	0,497 > q \left(\up{42}{15}\right)^2,
\end{equation*}
which is clear from \ref{15.48}.

We have to show that the subrectangles $\{2112, 311\}$ and $\{1112, 32\}$ overlap.

The condition \ref{15.25} should take place, with
\Tp{51}{43}{16}{13}
which expands to
\begin{equation*}
	0,88 > q \up{43}{13} \up{51}{16},
\end{equation*}
which follows from \ref{15.34}.

Showing that $\{1112, 33\}$ is good.
The following inequality should take place:
\begin{equation*}
	\g - \g' < 3,8 (\d - \d')
\end{equation*}
with
\Tp{40}{40}{28}{22}
which follows from
\begin{equation*}
	0,315 < q \left(\up{40}{28}\right)^2,
\end{equation*}
following from \ref{15.7}.

It is easy to check that $\{1112, 33\}$ and $\{2112, 311\}$ overlap.
Showing that $\{1112, 33\}$ overlaps with $\{2112, 32\}$.
We need the condition \ref{15.15} with
\Tp[.]{47}{45}{25}{18}
Obtain inequality
\begin{equation*}
	0,202 < q \up{45}{18} \up{47}{25},
\end{equation*}
following from \ref{15.7}.

Consider the subrectangle $\{3112, 32\}$.
Proving its goodness.
We need
\begin{equation*}
	3,8 (\g - \g') > \d - \d'
\end{equation*}
with
\Tp{35}{49}{17}{15}
expanding to
\begin{equation*}
	0,69 < q \up{35}{15} \up{49}{17},
\end{equation*}
which follows from \ref{15.34}.
Indeed,
\begin{equation*}
	1,12 > \uu{35}{29} \pp{49}{54} \pp{25}{15} \pp{29}{17}.
\end{equation*}
This is checked by substituting both $p$ and $p'$ with $0,8$, increasing the rhs.

The subrectangles $\{2112, 32\}$ and $\{3112, 32\}$ overlap.
It is shown by the condition \ref{15.15} with the following constants:
\Tp[.]{49}{51}{19}{16}
Obtain inequality
\begin{equation*}
	0,297 < q \up{49}{16} \up{51}{19},
\end{equation*}
following from \ref{15.7}.

Now showing that $\{3112, 32\}$ overlaps with $\{2112, 33\}$.
We need \ref{15.25} with the following constants:
\Tp{54}{50}{23}{20}
which follows from
\begin{equation*}
	0,9 > q \left(\up{54}{20}\right)^2,
\end{equation*}
which follows from \ref{15.7}.

\subsection{Segment between $\{2, 1\}$ and $\{2, 2\}$}

Now we will turn to constructing the system of subrectangles which covers the interval
\begin{equation*}
	\D_3 = \left(
		\D_1''(2) + \D_2''(2);
		\D_1'(2) + \D_2'(1)
	\right).
\end{equation*}

At first, we will figure out the condition that $\{2, 1\}$ and $\{2, 2\}$ overlap.
We need the inequality \ref{15.4} with
\Tp{64}{61}{64}{61}
which is equivalent to
\begin{equation}\label{15.49}
	0,714 > q \up{61}{61} \up{64}{64}.
\end{equation}

If \ref{15.49} takes place, then the inequality \ref{15.25} also takes place, with
\Tp{63}{30}{66}{63}
obtaining the condition
\begin{equation}\label{15.50}
	0,696 > q \up{30}{63} \up{63}{66}.
\end{equation}

How consider the case we're having the following constants in \ref{15.15}:
\Tp{30}{25}{81}{66}
expanding to
\begin{equation}\label{15.51}
	0,657 < q \up{35}{66} \up{30}{81}.
\end{equation}

To justify the choice of $\T{\g'}$ and $\T{\d}$, we need to check the condition \ref{15.4} for constants
\Tp{28}{22}{82}{80}
which expands to
\begin{equation}\label{15.52}
	0,842 > q \up{22}{80} \up{28}{82}.
\end{equation}

If \ref{15.52} doesn't take place, then we can set $\T{\g'} = \T{20}$ and, instead of \ref{15.51}, we will obtain
\begin{equation}\label{15.53}
	0,761 < q \up{20}{66} \up{30}{81},
\end{equation}
which takes place, in the consideration of \ref{15.52}.

At first, assume that \ref{15.52} doesn't take place, that is,
\begin{equation}\label{15.54}
	0,6569 \geqslant q \up{25}{66} \up{30}{81}.
\end{equation}
Checking the condition \ref{15.25} with the following constants:
\Tp[.]{25}{3}{84}{81}
which is equivalent to
\begin{equation*}
	0,6027 > q \up{3}{81} \up{25}{84},
\end{equation*}
which follows from \ref{15.54}:
\begin{equation*}
	0,9175 > q \pp{66}{84} \uu{3}{30},
\end{equation*}
which is easily checked by substituting $p$ with $[ 0; 1, 3, 4] \geqslant 0,764$ and $p'$ with $0,25$.

\subsection{Name}

Now consider the subrectangles $\{213, 122\}$, $\{113, 123\}$, and $\{113, 122\}$.

It is easy to check that they overlap.
We will check the inequality
\begin{equation}\label{15.55}
	\g - \g' < \d - \d',
\end{equation}
where
\Tp{30}{13}{86}{65}
which expands to
\begin{equation*}
	0,522 < q \up{13}{66} \up{30}{86}.
\end{equation*}

Let this inequality doesn't hold, that is,
\begin{equation}\label{15.56}
	0,522 \geqslant q \up{13}{66} \up{30}{86}.
\end{equation}

Showing that $\{113, 122\}$ and $\{113, 1211\}$ overlap.
The condition \ref{15.25} takes place with the following $\Th$'s:
\Tp{13}{10}{87}{86}
obtaining
\begin{equation*}
	0,518 > q \left(\up{13}{86}\right)^2,
\end{equation*}
which follows from \ref{15.56}.

Now in \ref{15.55} we can set $\T{\d} = \T{88}$ and obtain
\begin{equation*}
	0,468 < q \up{13}{66} \up{30}{88}.
\end{equation*}

If this inequality doesn't take place, then the inequality \ref{15.49} follows from
\begin{equation*}
	\uu{61}{13} \uu{64}{30} \pp{66}{61} \pp{68}{64} < 1,53,
\end{equation*}
while the condition \ref{15.50} follows from
\begin{equation*}
	\uu{63}{13} \pp{88}{63} < 1,48.
\end{equation*}

The subrectangle $\{23, 112\}$ overlaps with $\{2, 2\}$,
if the condition \ref{15.25} with the following constants takes place:
\Tp{63}{16}{70}{59}
which can be rewritten as
\begin{equation*}
	0,988 > q \up{16}{59} \up{63}{70},
\end{equation*}
following from the fact that $\D$ is horizontal:
\begin{equation*}
	1 \geqslant q \up{1}{1} \up{95}{95}.
\end{equation*}

Indeed,
\begin{equation*}
	\uu{16}{1} \uu{63}{95} \pp{1}{59} \pp{95}{70} < 0,988.
\end{equation*}

Substituting $\left(1 + p' \T{1}\right)\left(1 + p' \T{95}\right)$
with $\left(1 + p' \T{59}\right)\left(1 + p' \cdot 0,64\right)$, increasing the lhs.

Increasing $p'$ to $0,8$, decreasing $p$ to $0,75$ and checking the inequality.

\subsection{Name}

Consider the subrectangle $\{113, 1111\}$.
We will show that it overlaps with $\{23, 112\}$.
The condition \ref{15.25} should take place, with the following constants:
\Tp{19}{10}{67}{62}
obtaining the inequality
\begin{equation*}
	1,15 > q \up{10}{62} \up{19}{67},
\end{equation*}
which follows from \textit{broken link}.
Indeed,
\begin{equation*}
	\uu{10}{1} \uu{19}{95} \pp{1}{62} \pp{95}{67} < 1,15,
\end{equation*}
and, increasing the lhs, obtain
\begin{equation*}
	\uu{10}{10} \uu{19}{95} \dfrac{1 + p' \cdot 0,63}{1 + p' \T{67}} < 1,15,
\end{equation*}
which is obvious.

Let's find out when the subrectangles $\{113, 1111\}$ and $\{23, 1111\}$ overlap.
The following condition is needed:
\begin{equation*}
	\g - \g' < \d - \d',
\end{equation*}
where
\Tp{16}{13}{76}{74}
which expands to
\begin{equation}\label{15.57}
	0,793 < q \up{13}{74} \up{16}{76}.
\end{equation}

Now check the condition
\begin{equation*}
	1,4 (\g - \g') < \d - \d',
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{equation*}
	\T{\d} = [0; 1111331] = 0,61035,\;
	\T{\g} = \T{17},\;
	\T{\g'} = \T{15},\;
	\T{\d'} = \T{73},
\end{equation*}
which follows from
\begin{equation*}
	0,78 < q \up{25}{73} \up{17}{96},
\end{equation*}
which yields from \ref{15.57}.

Checking the condition
\begin{equation*}
	\g - \g' > 1,7 (\d - \d'),
\end{equation*}
where
\Tp{14}{12}{77}{75}
expanding to
\begin{equation*}
	q \up{12}{75} \up{14}{77} < 0,98,
\end{equation*}
which obviously follows from the horizontality of $\D$, \ref{horizontality}.

If \ref{15.57} doesn't take place and
\begin{equation}\label{15.58}
	0,793 \geqslant q \up{13}{74} \up{16}{76},
\end{equation}
then checking that $\{113, 1111\}$ and $\{113, 1112\}$ overlap.

For this, we need the following inequality to take place:
\begin{equation*}
	\g - \g' > \d - \d',
\end{equation*}
where
\Tp{13}{10}{78}{76}
which follows from \ref{15.58}.

It is easy to check that $\{113, 1112\}$ overlaps with $\{23, 1111\}$.

Checking that
\begin{equation*}
	3,8 (\g - \g') > \d - \d',
\end{equation*}
where
\Tp{28}{22}{96}{73}
obtaining
\begin{equation*}
	1,26 > q \up{22}{73} \up{28}{96},
\end{equation*}
which follows from \ref{horizontality}:
\begin{equation*}
	\pp{1}{73} \pp{95}{96} \uu{22}{1} \uu{28}{95} < 1,26,
\end{equation*}
which is true.

Finally, obtain the following sequence of subrectangles:
\begin{equation*}
	\{33, 1111\},\;
	\{23, 1112\},\;
	\{23, 1112\},\;
	\{23, 1113\},\;
	\{33, 1112\}.
\end{equation*}

Showing that $\{33, 1112\}$ overlap with $\{33, 1113\}$.
We need
\begin{equation*}
	\g - \g' > \d - \d',
\end{equation*}
where
\Tp{25}{23}{81}{79}
equivalent to
\begin{equation*}
	1,12 > q \up{23}{79} \up{25}{81},
\end{equation*}
which follows from \ref{horizontality}.
