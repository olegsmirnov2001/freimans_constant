\section{Initial set of rectangles}

We present a set of rectangles
whose projections cover the segment from the Freiman's constant to $\sqrt{21}$.
All of them are good.
Further sections will present the algorithm of splitting these rectangles into subrectangles correctly.

\textit{
	I am planning to translate this part
	after I deal with the splitting.
